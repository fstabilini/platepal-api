{"myRecipes":[{"idMeal":"52965","strMeal":"Breakfast Potatoes","strCategory":"Breakfast","strInstructions":"Before you do anything, freeze your bacon slices that way when you're ready to prep, it'll be so much easier to chop!\r\nWash the potatoes and cut medium dice into square pieces. To prevent any browning, place the already cut potatoes in a bowl filled with water.\r\nIn the meantime, heat 1-2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Tilt the skillet so the oil spreads evenly.\r\nOnce the oil is hot, drain the potatoes and add to the skillet. Season with salt, pepper, and Old Bay as needed.\r\nCook for 10 minutes, stirring the potatoes often, until brown. If needed, add a tablespoon more of oil.\r\nChop up the bacon and add to the potatoes. The bacon will start to render and the fat will begin to further cook the potatoes. Toss it up a bit! The bacon will take 5-6 minutes to crisp.\r\nOnce the bacon is cooked, reduce the heat to medium-low, add the minced garlic and toss. Season once more. Add dried or fresh parsley. Control heat as needed.\r\nLet the garlic cook until fragrant, about one minute.\r\nJust before serving, drizzle over the maple syrup and toss. Let that cook another minute, giving the potatoes a caramelized effect.\r\nServe in a warm bowl with a sunny side up egg!","strMealThumb":"https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/1550441882.jpg","strYoutube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoD0TIO9nE4","strIngredient1":"Potatoes","strIngredient2":"Olive Oil","strIngredient3":"Bacon","strIngredient4":"Garlic Clove","strIngredient5":"Maple Syrup","strIngredient6":"Parsley","strIngredient7":"Salt","strIngredient8":"Pepper","strIngredient9":"Allspice","strMeasure1":"3 Medium","strMeasure2":"1 tbs","strMeasure3":"2 strips","strMeasure4":"Minced","strMeasure5":"1 tbs","strMeasure6":"Garnish","strMeasure7":"Pinch","strMeasure8":"Pinch","strMeasure9":"To taste"},{"idMeal":"52969","strMeal":"Chakchouka ","strCategory":"Miscellaneous","strInstructions":"In a large cast iron skillet or sauté pan with a lid, heat oil over medium high heat. Add the onion and sauté for 2-3 minutes, until softened. Add the peppers and garlic, and sauté for an additional 3-5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, cumin, paprika, salt, and chili powder. Mix well and bring the mixture to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium low and continue to simmer, uncovered, 10-15 minutes until the mixture has thickened to your desired consistency. (Taste the sauce at this point and adjust for salt and spice, as desired.) Using the back of a spoon, make four craters in the mixture, large enough to hold an egg. Crack one egg into each of the craters. Cover the skillet and simmer for 5-7 minutes, until the eggs have set. Serve immediately with crusty bread or pita.","strMealThumb":"https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/gpz67p1560458984.jpg","strYoutube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHKNu93MSx4","strIngredient1":"Tomatoes","strIngredient2":"Olive Oil","strIngredient3":"Onion","strIngredient4":"Red Pepper","strIngredient5":"Green Pepper","strIngredient6":"Garlic","strIngredient7":"Cumin","strIngredient8":"Paprika","strIngredient9":"Salt","strIngredient10":"Chili Powder","strIngredient11":"Eggs","strMeasure1":"4","strMeasure2":"2 tbs","strMeasure3":"1 Diced","strMeasure4":"1 sliced","strMeasure5":"1 sliced","strMeasure6":"3 Cloves Crushed","strMeasure7":"1 tsp ","strMeasure8":"1 tsp ","strMeasure9":"3/4 teaspoon","strMeasure10":"1/2 teaspoon","strMeasure11":"4"},{"idMeal":"52874","strMeal":"Beef and Mustard Pie","strCategory":"Beef","strInstructions":"Preheat the oven to 150C/300F/Gas 2.\r\nToss the beef and flour together in a bowl with some salt and black pepper.\r\nHeat a large casserole until hot, add half of the rapeseed oil and enough of the beef to just cover the bottom of the casserole.\r\nFry until browned on each side, then remove and set aside. Repeat with the remaining oil and beef.\r\nReturn the beef to the pan, add the wine and cook until the volume of liquid has reduced by half, then add the stock, onion, carrots, thyme and mustard, and season well with salt and pepper.\r\nCover with a lid and place in the oven for two hours.\r\nRemove from the oven, check the seasoning and set aside to cool. Remove the thyme.\r\nWhen the beef is cool and you're ready to assemble the pie, preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.\r\nTransfer the beef to a pie dish, brush the rim with the beaten egg yolks and lay the pastry over the top. Brush the top of the pastry with more beaten egg.\r\nTrim the pastry so there is just enough excess to crimp the edges, then place in the oven and bake for 30 minutes, or until the pastry is golden-brown and cooked through.\r\nFor the green beans, bring a saucepan of salted water to the boil, add the beans and cook for 4-5 minutes, or until just tender.\r\nDrain and toss with the butter, then season with black pepper.\r\nTo serve, place a large spoonful of pie onto each plate with some green beans alongside.","strMealThumb":"https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/sytuqu1511553755.jpg","strYoutube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMyBC9staMU","strIngredient1":"Beef","strIngredient2":"Plain Flour","strIngredient3":"Rapeseed Oil","strIngredient4":"Red Wine","strIngredient5":"Beef Stock","strIngredient6":"Onion","strIngredient7":"Carrots","strIngredient8":"Thyme","strIngredient9":"Mustard","strIngredient10":"Egg Yolks","strIngredient11":"Puff Pastry","strIngredient12":"Green Beans","strIngredient13":"Butter","strIngredient14":"Salt","strIngredient15":"Pepper","strMeasure1":"1kg","strMeasure2":"2 tbs","strMeasure3":"2 tbs","strMeasure4":"200ml","strMeasure5":"400ml","strMeasure6":"1 finely sliced","strMeasure7":"2 chopped","strMeasure8":"3 sprigs","strMeasure9":"2 tbs","strMeasure10":"2 free-range","strMeasure11":"400g","strMeasure12":"300g","strMeasure13":"25g","strMeasure14":"pinch","strMeasure15":"pinch"},{"idMeal":"53025","strMeal":"Ful Medames","strCategory":"Vegetarian","strInstructions":"As the cooking time varies depending on the quality and age of the beans, it is good to cook them in advance and to reheat them when you are ready to serve. Cook the drained beans in a fresh portion of unsalted water in a large saucepan with the lid on until tender, adding water to keep them covered, and salt when the beans have softened. They take 2–2 1/2 hours of gentle simmering. When the beans are soft, let the liquid reduce. It is usual to take out a ladle or two of the beans and to mash them with some of the cooking liquid, then stir this back into the beans. This is to thicken the sauce.\r\nServe the beans in soup bowls sprinkled with chopped parsley and accompanied by Arab bread.\r\nPass round the dressing ingredients for everyone to help themselves: a bottle of extra-virgin olive oil, the quartered lemons, salt and pepper, a little saucer with the crushed garlic, one with chili-pepper flakes, and one with ground cumin.\r\nThe beans are eaten gently crushed with the fork, so that they absorb the dressing.\r\nOptional Garnishes\r\nPeel hard-boiled eggs—1 per person—to cut up in the bowl with the beans.\r\nTop the beans with a chopped cucumber-and-tomato salad and thinly sliced mild onions or scallions. Otherwise, pass round a good bunch of scallions and quartered tomatoes and cucumbers cut into sticks.\r\nServe with tahina cream sauce (page 65) or salad (page 67), with pickles and sliced onions soaked in vinegar for 30 minutes.\r\nAnother way of serving ful medames is smothered in a garlicky tomato sauce (see page 464).\r\nIn Syria and Lebanon, they eat ful medames with yogurt or feta cheese, olives, and small cucumbers.\r\nVariations\r\nA traditional way of thickening the sauce is to throw a handful of red lentils (1/4 cup) into the water at the start of the cooking.\r\nIn Iraq, large brown beans are used instead of the small Egyptian ones, in a dish called badkila, which is also sold for breakfast in the street.","strMealThumb":"https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/lvn2d51598732465.jpg","strYoutube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixpCabILuxw","strIngredient1":"Broad Beans","strIngredient2":"Parsley","strIngredient3":"Olive Oil","strIngredient4":"Lemons","strIngredient5":"Garlic Clove","strIngredient6":"Cumin","strMeasure1":"2 cups ","strMeasure2":"1/3 cup","strMeasure3":"Dash","strMeasure4":"3","strMeasure5":"4","strMeasure6":"Sprinking"},{"idMeal":"52868","strMeal":"Kidney Bean Curry","strCategory":"Vegetarian","strInstructions":"Heat the oil in a large frying pan over a low-medium heat.
